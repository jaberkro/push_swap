# push_swap
A dive into sorting algorithms

This program will print out the needed commands to sort the input using 2 stacks and a given set of allowed commands. It will not give back the sorted stack.

The algorithm used is radix sort with bitwise operations. In the main there is an explanation on how to change this used algorithm to bubble sort, radix sort in decimals and bucket sort with 5 buckets. There you can also see the stats of the different sorting algorithms.
